## Description
This project contains Postman collections and environments designed for testing the Trello API. The project includes basic operations such as Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) for managing data in Trello.

## Setup
1. **Import the collection**:
   - Open Postman and go to "Collections".
   - Click on "Import" and select the `Trello_Web_Services.postman_collection.json` file.

2. **Import the environment**:
   - Open Postman and go to "Environments".
   - Click on "Import" and select the `Trello_Web_Services_Environment.postman_environment.json` file.

3. **Configure the variables**:
   - In the imported environment, the `apiKey` and `apiToken` variables are test values created specifically for the purposes of the project. Users can replace them with their own credentials from Trello if desired.

## Running the Tests
- After setup, you can run the tests directly from Postman. Select the collection and click "Run" to start.
